Our boat adventures depart from the Yacht Basin Marina on Lake Macatawa in Holland, Michigan. Customize your trip to fit your crew. We offer rides along the beautiful shores of Lake Michigan, swimming and climbing dunes between Holland and Saugatuck. Dinner cruises to the adjacent ports of Grand Haven and Saugatuck. Bachelor parties, bachelorette parties, sightseeing, or a sunset cruise: you name it and we do our best to make it happen!

The boat adventures operate from mid-April through mid-October. We can accommodate groups of six (Coast Guard law) and provide water/pop, plastic utensils, cups, bowls, and plates. Catering available upon request.

Examples of various types of trips:

- Family outings

## What to Bring

Alcohol is permitted on the boat for anybody of legal age. That said, we do ask that no glass bottles be brought on the boat and that the alcohol be consumed in a responsible manner.
