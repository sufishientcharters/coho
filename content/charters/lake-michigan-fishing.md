Our Lake Michigan fishing charters depart from the Yacht Basin Marina on Lake Macatawa in Holland, Michigan. We fish for lake trout, salmon, and steelhead along the beautiful shores of Grand Haven, Holland, and Saugatuck.

Charter fishing operates from mid-April through mid-October. We can accommodate groups of six (Coast Guard law).
