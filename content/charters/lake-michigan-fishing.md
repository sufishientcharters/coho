Our Lake Michigan fishing charters depart from the Yacht Basin Marina on Lake Macatawa in Holland, Michigan. We fish for lake & steelhead trout and salmon along the beautiful shores of Grand Haven, Holland, and Saugatuck.

Charter fishing operates from mid-April through mid-October. We can accommodate groups of six (Coast Guard law).
