Went fishing for the first time With my wife and teen boys. Jeff was very knowledgeable and patient with our first timer questions.

Our family had an amazing experience. Jeff provided exact instructions on what to expect and what to bring and what to leave behind. He was ready at 6 am on a chilly morning with a big smile.

He kept chatting with the boys providing hints and tips on the do’s and don’ts. We ended up catching 9 trouts and were very happy with our catch.

To sweeten the experience at the end Jeff brought out a caramel peanut rice cake that his wife had graciously baked. Thanks Jeff!

If we had to go fishing in Holland MI, it will be with Jeff’s SuFISHicient Charters.
