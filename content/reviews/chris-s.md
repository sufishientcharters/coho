Awesome fishing experience, would definitely recommend suFISHient Charters. We enjoyed fresh baked cookies prepared by Jeff's wife while heading out. Jeff and his first mate Mark set out multiple lines and my husband, my dad and I were reeling in Salmon in no time! While tending the lines and netting our fish, they gave us great advice and three new Salmon recipes to try. Before we knew it, we had caught our limit and were heading back in feeling like pros. Back at the dock, Jeff filleted our fish while Mark tended the boat.

Jeff and his first mate Mark were fun and professional. We will definitely use them again the next time we are in Holland. A couple of photos of the ones we reeled in.

Thanks again Jeff and Mark for a wonderful fishing trip!
