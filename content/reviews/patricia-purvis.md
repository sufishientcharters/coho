Absolutely best charter out there! Jeff was solo, no first mate, he booked us the day prior, and even let us bump up the trip by a half an hour. We caught our limit on trout and salmon before 9am! He definitely knows what he's doing. Jeff was extremely knowledgeable and was willing to share some tricks of the trade. He knows the area very well and put us on fish right away. We caught some big beauties, a whole cooler full. Fantastic day. By the way his wife's cookies were delicious too!
