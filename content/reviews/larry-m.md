My son and I went out with SuFISHient last week while on vacation. They have a very nice boat with lots of room to fish. We had a great time with the team. The captain is very good with his boat and works hard to get us into the places where the fish are. He knows a lot about fishing in that area and what is biting and what the fish like.

We caught a good number of fish and several of them being quite large. We were right on the brink of great Salmon season and managed to catch a few of these fish. I highly recommend this company for fishing on Lake Michigan.
